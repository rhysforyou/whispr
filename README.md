![Whispr-Zero hassle, accountless web chat](https://raw.github.com/rpowelll/whispr/master/public/media/repoLogo.png)

Whispr is a dead simple, zero account, disposable chat app buit on
[Meteor][meteor]. 

It's built for people who want to get a web chat running without the hasle of
more traditional solutions. For people who want quick and easy private chat
rooms that are as simple to set up as clicking a button. When someone wants to
join your chat, all they have to do is follow a link. It's that simple.

The app itself is built entirely in [Meteor][meteor], a next generation web
framework written in JavaScript. I'm not the world's best coder, but I hope
Whispr's code base provides a great example for anyone trying to learn that
framework.
